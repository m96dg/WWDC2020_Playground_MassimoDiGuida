# WWDC2020_Playground_MassimoDiGuida
My journey to WWDC 2020 - No Winner


For development of this playground I used Swift Playgrounds 3.3 on MacOS 10.15.4 and to check the correct functioning I used the iPad Pro 10.5.
I used the SpriteKit and UIKit frameworks. I mainly used: SKTransition, SKSpriteNode, SKTexture, SKPhysicsBody. 
I managed the timer and the physics of the nodes created, as well as the collisions between them. 
The entire playground design was made by myself. For the sounds, however, I used an open source site, giving the related credits on the final page of the playground.
So Iâ€™m very proud of it.

Next year I will retry to win WWDC! Stay tuned!
